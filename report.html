      <h1>Our report</h1>
      <p>
        Firstly, we found some website to not be accessible because they used gradients
        badly. From that observation, it was obvious to keep the website in specific colours, 
        and not use gradient (such as a darker side and lighter towards the centre of the
        page), since it made the websites hard to read for people with low vision. 
        Since the grey in between the text and background, the gradient made them in indistinguishable.
        We kept a lot of text white to make it more visible with a
        strong contrast with black and darkish blue colour as background.
        This became better for the reader to read and navigate. 
        Therefor we managed to include more people, who have low vision for example
        for our website.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Secondly, we though a lot of how to create our menu (index.html).
        We wanted to keep the reader focused on our menu such as 
        lunch, dinner and snacks. From having a clear contrast, but also 
        putting on borders on the divs for each meal, we made the meals 
        seem more interesting for the reader. Thereby the reader
        would look on the middle of the menu when they saw each meal.
      </p>

  
      <p>  
        When it came to making the contact.html and location.html 
        easier to find, we had the information in both footer
        and header, so you could find the information on either 
        contact or location at the top and at the bottom of the 
        page. We have from our observations noticed that a lot of
        other websites had their contact information at the bottom,
        which makes sense for us because the reader would first look
        through what the website would offer before you would
        figure out how to make contact. Therefor the contact 
        information is also at the bottom of the website and at the top
        you can find the opening hours for the restaurant.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        When we wrote the website, we knew that allergens are 
        quite important to know of, be it either you have allergens, 
        low vision or reading disabilities. We took good use of
        emphasis tags, so the reader would focus on reading the allergens, 
        but also makes it easier for people who use screen readers. 
        We included people suffering from allergens with such tags, 
        also, to mention, we used strong tags as well together with a 
        clear and concise colour contrast on the text for the 
        reader so the text would not become hard to view.  
      </p>
      
      <p>
        When it came to making the contact form, we made sure to 
        create descriptive labels and placeholder. This is to ensure
        people who depend on screen readers will be provided with visible
        descriptions and larger clickable targets for form controls.
        There was not difference in our first test and second test of our website.
        Since our test on the website on github with the automated WCAG testing, 
        it was not found to be any major yellow or red warnings. Therefor based on
        the feedback we got; we did not need to change anything.
